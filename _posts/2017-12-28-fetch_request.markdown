A fetch request is an API call to a url with the intentions of retrieving data. The response to the fetch request is an object known as a Response Object, which contains metadata pertaining to the properties of the API url called. The response can be converted to a data-interchange format such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Fetch request functions are an example of JavaScript Promises, allowing asynchronous actions rather than the typical inline. While the Response Object is what is initially returned from a fetch request, the conversion of the data into a data-interchange format is often required for easier data manipultation.
