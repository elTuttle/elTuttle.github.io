A common theme in the Flatiron course has been learning to crawl before you can walk, learning Sinatra before Rails, HTML before Jquery, and now Javascript before React. This approach provides the most valuable part of this course, an understanding of how everything works. With the combination of Rails and React, the ability to create a powerful website is not only on plausibe but rather simple now, but more important than being able to create those sites, is knowing how they work, the same sites could be built with Sinatra and normal HTML and Javascript, and I have the knowledge now to do so if needed. Rails and React are powerful tools, the knowledge and journey to learning how they work is much more powerful.
