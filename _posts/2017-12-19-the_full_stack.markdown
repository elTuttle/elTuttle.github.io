Between HTML, Ruby, and Javascript, I really feel like im beginning to become a swiss army knife of web development. The Jquery Rails app had me coding in three different languages, switching between langauges often to create a cohesive product that is really starting to come to life. WHile the syntax is different, often the logic for Javascript and Ruby is the same, and the main struggle has been which langauge solves what problem. Ultimately Ruby is starting to take the back end side of things, working more with the server and database while javascript is in charge of the dom and interactivity.
