On top of the obvious change in my coding abilities over the past few months, my thought process has began to change too. The world is full of problems and we as humans have the ability to find the solutions, coding is almost an analogy for what it means to be human. We begin, we end, but what really matters is the stuff that happens in between the brackets. What we accomplish, how we accomplish it, and what/who we help. There will always be a new problem to debug, something that goes unexpected, but if we sit back and breath, and maybe make a cup of tea, we can find the solution.
