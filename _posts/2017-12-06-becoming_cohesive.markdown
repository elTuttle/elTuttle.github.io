With another portfolio project coming to an end, I am starting to feel as though everything is coming together. I can look at websites and understand how they work, how I could do the same. While my projects and execution might be very barebones now, with how far I've come from starting Flatiron, I know soon I will be able to create applications and code that I can be proud of and hopefully showcase to the world. Rails has been fun for me, I get joy looking at the directories and their size because it feels like an accomplishment to have been able to write so much on my own and create a working, functional product.
