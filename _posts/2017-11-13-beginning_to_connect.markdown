The Sinatra Portfolio Project marked an important moment in my Flatiron course, for the first time I'm starting to use all the knowledge and languages that I've learned so far. Ideas for my own applications in the future are starting to come to me and I'm analyzing how I would make it. I am even more excited now for what I'll be able to do once I have completed the course and how I can use the knowledge in my own personal career.
