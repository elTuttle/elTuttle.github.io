Some families are sports families, some families run a business, my family is programmers and engineers. My dad is the manager of database service at a major company, my family was supported off of SQL code. My grandfathers both worked for IBM and my mother's father also was one of the first to write software that helps with stock trading. I've been programming since middle school and have found a means to be creative in coding and hope to make a career out of the joy I have while programming.
